# challenge-4-code-quiz

## Description

This was my 4th homework assignment for my bootcamp. In this project we were told to make a Code Quiz Website from scratch. It had to have a timer, multiple questions that dissappeared when answered, time subtracted when wrong answers were picked, and a way to keep your score locally stored. This was a really fun project for me that only took me a couple sessions to finish in one day to meet all the criteria.

## Usage

This is a fun mini-quiz to test your wits. Your score is stored locally and only shows your most recent score saved. The main goal is to answer as fast as you can and get the Highest time possible. If you choose the wrong answer you'll have time subtracted from your timer.
